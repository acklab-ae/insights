## Overview
This is an insightful personality test.  The overall goal is to determine what type of personality based on Myers Briggs.  
A few things I'd like to add on this core code:
- Webify the questionaire
- Seperate the questions from the code base and just pull in questions from either a file or a database
- Provide export capabilities of results
- Add teaming functionalities that allows teams to evaluate the team dynamics
- Import data / maybe add previous performance records
